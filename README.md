# Item-Recovery-Problem-ALNS
This repository contains the source code for an ALNS-based optimization technique for the "item recovery problem", which is an optimization problem where an AUV with a maximum carry weight must visit multiple sites and recover items (i.e. bring them to a "base site") of different weights.
